    <p>A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike, push-bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-powered assisted, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.</p>
    <p>Feel the wind in your hair and the sun on your face as you glide along on your trusty bicycle. Escape the confines of traffic jams and crowded subways and discover the joy of exploring your city or countryside at your own pace. With every pedal stroke, you'll feel a surge of energy and invigoration as you reconnect with the natural world around you.</p>
    <p>Cycling isn't just about getting from point A to point B; it's about investing in your well-being. With every pedal stroke, you'll strengthen your heart, boost your energy levels, and reduce stress. Cycling is a low-impact exercise that's gentle on your joints, making it an ideal activity for people of all ages and fitness levels.</p>
